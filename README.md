MS Thesis, nfl tracking work, literature

Use NFL tracking data to classify safeties, cornerbacks to man vs zone coverage. Then, use that information to look into how it influences WR routes and how play outcomes differ based on coverage and type of route that was run.

The GMM framework is adapted from this paper: Unsupervised Methods for Identifying Pass Coverage Among Defensive Backs with NFL Player Tracking Data

I built upon this by including safeties in the analysis and including orientation data. The analysis on receivers is entirely my own.

Methods: Gaussian mixture model, K-means for modeling, otherwise remainder of work was exploratory analysis
